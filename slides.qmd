- Olexandr Konovalov (Lecturer at St. Andrews)
- Michael Tso (Research Data Scientist at UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology)
- Alessandro Felder (Research Software Engineer at University College London)

# Context

- Preservation of historic Ukrainian heritage requires data skills
- Programming Historian provides teaching material for this, and ad-hoc translation efforts exist, but these don't scale well due to lack of infrastructure and documentation
- Carpentries internationalisation infrastructure, using a tool called `transifex`, has been successful in the last year

# Hackday idea
- to reuse and adapt the setup used by the Carpentries in order to establish the similar infrastructure for the Programming Historian.

# Collaboration tools

- GH project board for draft issue tracking (when repos don't exist yet!)
- `hackmd` shared doc
- talking to each other!

# Plan
![](images/2_first_try.png){height=300}

- test `transifex` manually
- create some sample translations
- fork programming historian to contribute sample translations as an example

# Redacted Plan

- test `transifex` manually
- create some sample translations
- ~~fork programming historian to contribute sample translations as an example~~
- create an intermediate preview site to make things simpler
